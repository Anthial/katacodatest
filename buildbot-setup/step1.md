The first step to getting BuildBot running on your machine through Docker, is making sure you've got Docker installed. 
Please run  `docker --version`{{execute HOST1}}


If this does not work, please install Docker (also useful for getting a local installation working) by running `sudo apt-get update`{{execute HOST1}}
Followed by `sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io`{{execute HOST1}}
